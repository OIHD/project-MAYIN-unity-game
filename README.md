# project-MAYIN-unity-game
A game inspired by minesweeper game.

### Free UNITY project

I prepared this project while learning the Unity game engine. I decided to post all the source code of the first project here. Beginners like me can review the entire project. You can develop and make your own game.

C# , Unity game engine is used.

## Platforms
> PC , WEB (Android & IOS )

## Features

- Variables, methods etc. all Turkish. (I know it's not universal. But since I wrote my first project to learn the game engine, I chose to write it in my own language. I plan to write my future projects in English)
- The entire project is open to access.
- It's free and open source ^^.
